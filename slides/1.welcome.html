# How this course works

--

## Lecture

I will speak for 125 minutes, four times per week.

--

- That's 500 minutes (8 hours 20 minutes) of talking each week.

--

- For your sake and mine, I sincerely hope that you will interrupt me.

--

- Ask lots of questions... comment upon the material... anything, please.

---

template: how-course-works

## Notes

I write notes for most lecture topics. You may find them useful but incomplete.

---

template: how-course-works

## Slides

I try to keep slides as a list of topics and points, for your future reference.

- They are, by nature, incomplete, unless I were to simply read from them like a robot.

---

template: how-course-works

## Reading

Reading assignments from the textbook and elsewhere each class.

--

- The textbook is quite thorough, but not exactly necessary if you pay close attention and are willing to do some self-study.

---

template: how-course-works

## Assignments

You will have somewhere around 10 assignments.

--

- You lose 10 points for each day late and we do not accept submissions more than 3 days late.

--

- See [the syllabus](#main-links) for the complete lateness policy.

## Extensions

Please do not ask for an extension.

--

- You are hereby granted 2 free extensions for work submitted up to 3 days past the due date.

---

template: how-course-works

## Quizzes

For every new topic, you will take a simple multiple-choice online quiz.

--

- These are meant to help you self-assess your own mastery of conceptual material.

--

- Try your [first quiz](https://forms.gle/5XXNtFUZ9JDicTqf8)!

---

template: how-course-works

## Exams

You will take 2 exams.

--

- They are likely to consist entirely of multiple-choice questions.

--

- Students who come to class do better.

---

template: how-course-works

## Grading

- 35% assignments
- 25% first exam
- 25% second and final exam
- 15% quizzes

## Messaging

We use Slack for all communication outside of the classroom.

--

- You must create a private channel in Slack with the name following the pattern, `assgn_fb1258`, where `fb1258` is replaced with your own NYU Net ID.

## Tutoring

Tutors are waiting to answer your questions virtually all day every day of the week.

--

- See them often. See them fast.

--

- Check [the syllabus](#main-links) for the complete tutoring schedule.

# What to do now

## Download and install a decent code editor

A decent code editor, such as Visual Studio Code, is indispensible. In fact, you are required to install Visual Studio Code:

- https://code.visualstudio.com

---

# What to do now

## Download and install a file transfer program.

In order to publish web pages, you must be able to transfer files from one computer to another on the internet. Cyberduck is a perfectly adequate free program to do so.

- https://cyberduck.io/

---

# What to do now

## Install Git

Git is "version control" software to help keep an archive of all changes in the code of a project.

- OS X users: https://git-scm.com/
- Windows users: https://gitforwindows.org/

---

# What to do now

## Set Up Bash on Windows

WINDOWS USERS - you should use Git Bash or [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (WSL) rather than Windows' default Powershell or other command line shell program.

- Set Git Bash or WSL as the default terminal shell within Visual Studio Code on Windows by following the instructions in [the second answer here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal) by **Mahade Walid** and edited by **FruityOatyBar** (ignore the first answe, which is outdated).

---

# What to do now

## Create a GitHub account

GitHub is a website owned by Microsoft for sharing and collaborating on code projects that use Git.

- https://github.com

# Conclusions

--

- Welcome!

--

- Look around the web... see what interesting things people are doing.

--

- Try to look at a diverse array of web sites and apps, not just Google, Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, etc.

--

- Thanks. Bye.
