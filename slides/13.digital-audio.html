# Overview

--

## Concept

We will take a look at the nature of sound, how it exists in the physical world, and how it is recorded and emitted by contemporary computers.

---

## What Is Sound

Sound is the perceptible sensation that animals have in response to cyclical vibrations of the air or other medium surrounding them.

--

> If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?

## Good vibrations

The vibration of air (or other transmission medium) radiates outward from the source, creating waves of changes to the pressure and density of air particles.

--

- The air particles do not travel with the sound... they simply vibrate in place, causing those particles next to them to vibrate, and so on.

## Perception

In humans and other [tetrapods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrapod), the vibrating air waves are channeled into the inner parts of the ear, where they cause a vibration of the eardrum, a.k.a. **tympanic membrane**, which in turn causes the vibration of the **cochlea**.

## Frequency and pitch

Different parts of the tympanic membrane vibrate in response to different frequencies of air vibration.

--

- Vibrations from each part of the tympanic membrane are _transduced_ into electrical signals, and sent along neurons to the brain.

--

- The patterns of these signals are interpreted and possibly recognized by the brain, leading to perception of different **pitches** and other of sound.

--

- watch [a video explaining how sound is perceived by the inner ear and brain](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Journey_of_Sound_to_the_Brain.ogv).

## The limits of perception

The average human is capable of hearing frequencies betweeen 20Hz and 20,000Hz.

--

- Lower frequencies are perceived as lower pitch.

--

- Higher frequencies are perceived as higher pitch.

--

- Frequencies use the unit, **Hertz**, which represents how many times per second a waveform oscillates back and forth.

--

- When it comes to sound waves, for example, 100Hz would mean that the air density and pressure increase and decrease cyclically 100 times per second.

--

- Give yourself [a quick-and-dirty hearing test](http://onlinetonegenerator.com/) (by no means conclusive) by playing sounds at different frequencies to see what you can perceive.

# Analog vs. Digital

--

## Analog

If one were to map the pressure variations in air of a single frequency of sound over time, it might look something like this:

---

template: analog-vs-digital

## Digital

A computer or other digital device has finite memory and storage, and can only do so many operations per second.

--

- For these reasons, a digital device can only record a certain number of **samples** of the amplitude of the actual physical sound each second.

--

- There is endless debate among audiophiles about whether humans can tell the difference between an analog signal and its well-sampled digital equivalent.

---

## ADC and DAC

The conversion of an analog to digital signal is termed **ADC**, while the reverse is **DAC**.

---

template: analog-vs-digital

## Fidelity (lo-fi)

A low **sample rate** in ADC leads to a poor quality representation of the original waveform.

---

## Fidelity (medium-fi)

A medium **sample rate** leads to an ok, but not great, quality representation of the original waveform.

## Fidelity (hi-fi)

A high **sample rate** leads to a good quality representation of the original waveform.

## Nyquist Shannon Theorum

Engineers named **Harry Nyquist** and **Claude Shannon** theorized and proved in 1928 and 1949, respectively, that in order to faithful reproduce a waveform, it had to be sampled at a rate at least twice its frequency.

--

- So, for example, a 20Hz wave would need to be sampled no less than 40 times per second.

--

- A 20,000Hz wave would need to be sampled no less than 40,000 times per second.

--

- If you recall, human hearing falls into the range of 20 - 20kHz.

--

- So the max sample rate a sound humans can hear would need would be about 40,000 samples per second.

--

- It will therefore not surprise you to learn that **[44.1kHz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/44%2C100_Hz)** is a common sample rate for digital audio, with 96kHz currently considered very high resolution.

---

## Bit depth

In addition to sample rate, another factor in the faithful reproduction of an analog audio signal is the bit depth.

--

- **Bit depth** refers to how many bits of data are used to represent each sample.

--

- For example, a bit depth of 2 bits per sample would allow one of 2<sup>2</sup> = 4 different values in any given sample.

--

- A bit depth of 16 bits per sample would allow one of 2<sup>16</sup> = 65536 different values in each sample. etc.

--

- Today, 32 bits per sample is considered high quality.

---

## Bit depth (continued)

Fitting the amplitude of the analog signal into the available bit depth of a sample is termed **quantization**.

--

- Higher bit depths allow a more faithful reproduction of the original analog signal.

# Audacity

--

## Audio recording software

**[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)** is a free, cross-platform, open source multi-track audio recording software.

--

- Audacity allows you to record and manipulate audio data down to the level of an individual sample.

---

## The lame MP3 format

While editing audio tracks, Audacity and other multi-track audio tools, will save in their own proprietary "layered" formats.

--

- However, most people prefer to share audio tracks in flat **MP3** format, which are playable on most computers and devices.

--

- In order to export as MP3, a proprietary _non-free_ format, Audacity includes an MP3 encoding tool called **LAME**.

--

- The LAME project has created from scratch a clone of an MP3 encoder much the same way that GNU created from scratch a clone of the UNIX operating system.

--

- LAME is a recursive acronym that stands for, "_LAME Ain't an MP3 Encoder_", in clear homage to GNU.

## MacOS Catalina (10.15) problems

Audacity currently will not be able to record audio if run on Mac's Catalina OS (OSX 10.15). Fortunately, there is an easy workaround.

--

- Download Audacity and place it into your `Applications` folder.

--

- Place the following code into a text file named `audacity.command` stored somewhere convenient, such as your `Desktop`.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# open Audacity from bash... otherwise it doesn't work on Mac Catalina
open /Applications/Audacity.app/Contents/MacOS/Audacity
```

--

- Give everyone execute permissions on this file from the command line:

```bash
chmod a+x audacity.command
```

--

- Whenever you want to launch Audacity, just double click this `audacity.command` file, rather than launching Audacity directly.

# Conclusions

--

We have now seen some of the conceptual details of how audio is stored and manipulated in a contemporary computer.

--

- An early 1980's television show named Bits and Bytes explained many of the concepts of digital audio very well in their [episode on Computer Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho8niBS1nrU). While hardware may have evolved since that time, the fundamental concepts behind digital audio have not.

--

- There are many Audacity tutorials available online, such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCisC3sHneM).

- Thank you. Bye.
