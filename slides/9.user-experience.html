# Overview

--

## Concept

**User Experience Design** (UxD), also known as Customer Experience Design (CxD), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), or Human-Centered Design, is the practice of _incorporating people's needs into the design_ of the software, documents, events, activities, or other experiences.

---

template: overview

## Assumptions

We design for people with a few assumptions in mind:

--

- **People use things for a reason**: typically a desire or need that they are trying to fulfill.

--

- **Creators have motives for making things**: often profit, esteem from peers, "keeping up-with-the-Jones's", etc.

--

- **Technologies all have constraints**: every tool has its inherent limitations that restrict what can be done with it.

---

## Everyone loves Venn diagrams...

... and User Experience Designers try to make all parties happy. This inevitably involves compromise.

# Requirements Gathering

--

## Concept

The first thing a UX Designer must do is establish what must be done - this is **requirements gathering**.

--

They use all resources available to them in order to determine the business goals, user needs, and technology constraints, including:

--

- **Stakeholder interviews** - speak with the important people at the organization for whom the product is being designed.

--

- **Competitive analysis** - see what the competitors are doing in this same space.

--

- **User interviews and observation** - speak with potential users and observe them while they go about doing the things your tool is intended to facilitate.

--

- **Demographic research** - review market research to understand the typical desires, problems, and needs of the average person in the demographic(s) you are targeting.

---

template: requirements

## Deliverables

The result of requirements gathering is often one or more **requirements documents**. These outline all that has been discovered about the project, e.g.

--

- **Business requirements** - the business goals and metrics that the project must achieve.

--

- **Technical requirements** - any rules about which technologies must be used and how they must operate.

--

- **Functional requirements** - what users must be able to do and find using the site.

--

- **Design requirements** - any particular design rules or style guides that must be followed.

--

- **Content requirements** - any particular pieces of content that must be published to the site.

# Site/App Maps

--

## Concept

Site/app maps are diagrams intended to show the number of categories of screens (e.g. web pages or app screens) that exist in a given web site and how many screens exist or must be built within each category.

---

template: site-maps

## Example

An example of a simple site map of a shoe shop web site.

---

template: site-maps

## Communication goals

Site/app map diagrams are simple, fast, easy-to-draw diagrams that communicate...

--

- **the number of unique design templates** that must be created.

--

- what **categories** of screens exist in a site.

--

- the **number of levels** of screens within each category, if a user were to _drill down_ step-by-step from each category _landing screen_ to its children screens.

---

template: site-maps

## Prohibitions

Site/app maps, in order to best serve their purpose, should not...

--

- indicate more screens than you are capable of developing, filling with content, and maintaining - **make a plan that is achievable**.

--

- attempt to show every link from every screen to every other screen - **draw lines for parent-to-child relationships only**

--

- have more levels than absolutely necessary - **err on the side of fewer levels**.

--

- have more categories than necessary - **err on the side of fewer categories**.

---

# Wireframe diagrams

--

## Concept

There are many types of specialized diagrams and documents produced by User Experience Designers to serve different communication needs:

--

- flow diagrams
- ecosystem maps
- user journeys
- content audits
- information taxonomies
- and more...

--

For our purposes - designing and developing screens quickly and mostly on our own - **wireframe diagrams** are the easiest to understand and produce, and provide the greatest benefit.

---

## Example

---

template: wireframes

## Communication goals

Wireframe diagrams are simple, fast, easy-to-draw diagrams that communicate...

--

- what **type of content** will be on each screen.

--

- the approximate **position and size** of each piece of content.

--

- **notes** about any content or interactive behavior that is not obvious just looking at the diagram

---

template: wireframes

## Prohibitions

Wireframes, in order to best serve their purpose, should not include...

--

- **color** - everything should be black, white, and gray

--

- **design** - no shadows, fancy fonts, logos, icons or other graphics

--

- **real images** - use placeholder boxes instead where an image would go

--

- **real text** (also known as 'copy') - use '[lorem ipsum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum)' placeholder copy instead

---

template: wireframes

## Number

Each wireframe diagram acts as a template that is then re-used for one or more screens. Most web designers will produce distinct wireframe diagrams for at least each of the following...

--

- **home screen** - these are usually unique and follow a different template from other screens.

--

- **each level of the site/app map** - screens at the same depth level will generally follow the same, or similar, template - one for each level.

--

- **unique screens** - some screens are, by nature, somewhat unique in content and/or layout - for example "Contact Us" screens with _forms_, marketing _brochure-like_ screens intended to give a unique look-and-feel, and others...

--

- **overlays** - any content that appears superimposed over other content when something is clicked or moused over, such as a _hamburger menu_.

# Flow diagrams

--

There are many different uses for flow diagrams - they are a general diagramming style to show directionality.

--

- One useful application within User Experience Design is to show the flow of control from one screen to another in an application or web site.

--

- This can make it very clear how the screens connect to one-another as the user uses the site/app.

# Prototyping

--

## Concept

Once initial wireframe diagrams have been drafted, it's easy to put together a **clickable prototype** of a web site using those wireframes. Benefits of a building a prototype include...

--

- for stakeholders to all agree that this is **how the website will function**.

--

- to **count how many clicks or taps** it might take for a user to get to the content that interests them.

--

- to **show to potential end-users** to get their feedback.

--

- to **do a sanity check** before spending time and effort building the site.

---

--

- [Proto.io](https://proto.io/) - free trial available

---

template: prototyping

## Requirements

When creating a clickable prototype, meet the following minimal requirements:

--

- all buttons, links or other user interface components that allow a user to navigate from one screen to another must be functional in the prototype

--

- create as many variations of your existing wireframe diagrams as you need in order to make the prototype look "believable"; give a real sense of how the application flow might work... don't take shortcuts.

--

- your prototypes must be designed to clearly show the way in which a user navigates from one screen to another, as well as how they solve the core use cases and needs your web site is designed to solve.

At this point you have a just enough information to get into trouble designing site/app maps, wireframes, and building clickable prototypes. Go for it!
