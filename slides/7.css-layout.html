# Overview

template: overview
name: overview-1

The layout of a web page is controlled by a few simple CSS concepts and rules. In order to get it right, we need to understand a few preliminary concepts.

---

name: containers

# Containers

---

template: containers
name: containers-1

## The HTML

To center the contents of a web page and to restrict the width of the page, we wrap the entire contents of the paage within a **container** or **wrapper** element.

```html
...
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <!-- put the contents of your page within this element -->
  </div>
</body>
...
```

---

template: containers
name: containers-2

## Restrict the page width

Now, we can easily restrict the page width to whatever width we like by adjusting this container's width.

```css
.container {
  width: 800px; /* you choose the width */
}
```

---

template: containers
name: containers-2

## Center the contents

We can also easily center the entire page within the browser's _viewport_ using margins.

```css
.container {
  width: 800px; /* container width must be smaller than the browser viewport width */
  /* equal margins on the left and right side of the containere */
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
```

---

template: containers
name: containers-3

## Warning: avoid setting heights

The height of the container, or any element for that matter, will always automatically adjust to fit the height of the contents you put within it.

If you were to set the height of an element to a fixed size, yet place more content nested within that element than can fit in that size, your layout would become corrupted.

# Calculating Widths

---

template: widths
name: widths-1

## The question

The width of an element can be a bit counter-intuitive to calculate.

Take this HTML:

```html
<article class="boxy">...</article>
```

And this CSS:

```css
.boxy {
  width: 400px;
  border: 1px solid red;
  padding: 20px;
  margin: 10px;
  background-color: pink;
}
```

What's the width of the `article` element?

---

template: widths
name: widths-2

## An answer

The actual width of an element includes:

- the _width_ of the element!
- any _border_ applied to either side of it
- any _padding_ applied to either side of it

```
actual width = width +
               left border + right border +
               left padding + right padding
```

---

template: widths
name: widths-3

## Another answer

The space consumed by an element also includes:

- any _margin_ applied to either side of it

```
actual width =  width +
                left border + right border +
                left padding + right padding +
                left margin + right margin
```

# Block vs. Inline Elements

---

template: block-inline
name: block-inline-1

## Concept

Layout behavior of HTML elements is largely determined by the value of their CSS `display` property. Let's focus first on 3 of these:

...

```css
display: block;
```

```css
display: inline;
```

```css
display: none;
```

...

Wwe will discuss two more important `display` values, [`grid`](#grid) and [`flex`](#flex), later.

---

template: block-inline
name: block-inline-2

## Common block elements

By default, the `display` property is set to `block` for many elements, including:

- `header`
- `footer`
- `main`
- `aside`
- `article`
- `section`
- `h1` - `h6`
- `p`
- `ul` and `ol`
- `li`
- `div`
- ... and more

---

template: block-inline
name: block-inline-3

## Block element behavior

The `display: block` setting causes the elements to have the following behavior:

- consume as much width as they can within their containing element
- refuse to sit side-by-side with other elements

---

template: block-inline
name: block-inline-4

## Common inline elements

By default, the `display` property is set to `inline` for many text-related elements and images, including:

- `a`
- `strong`
- `em`
- `img`
- `span`
- ... and more

---

template: block-inline
name: block-inline-5

## Inline element behavior

The `inline` value will cause the elements to have the following behavior:

- consume only as much width as they need to surround the contents nested within them.
- happily sit side-by-side with other elements.

---

template: block-inline
name: block-inline-6

## Effects

The block/inline difference means that...

- we cannot set the widths of inline elements
- we also cannot set the left or right padding of inline elements
- we must use `block` elements to build the structure or skeleton of our web pages
- we will have to do extra work to get block elements to sit side-by-side
- inline elements will be used only to style bits of text and images.

# A Word About Divs and Spans

---

template: divs-spans
name: divs-spans-1

## Concept

There are two elements we will frequently use that have no semantic meaning:

- `div` - a `block` element with no semantic meaning
- `span` - an `inline` element with no semantic meaning

These are useful when you want to surround some content that you want to apply a style to, but you don't want to adjust that content's semantic meaning.

- So much for the much-touted _separation of concerns_!

# Position

template: position
name: position-1

## Positioning using the CSS position property

It is sometimes tempting to use the CSS position property to position elements on the page... it sounds like this is what the property is intended for.

The CSS `position` property can take three values:

- `static` - keep the element at its default position on the page
- `relative` - allows us to move the element from its static position by a particular number of pixels in the `top` or `left` directions
- `absolute` - allows us to absolutely position an element relative to the top-left corner of the page
- `fixed` - allows us to have an element stuck in the browser viewport at a specific position relative to the top-left corner of the viewport.

---

template: position
name: position-2

## Do not use these for general web page layout.

These `position` values are useful in some specific advanced contexts, but should never be used to layout the positions of all the main parts of a web page.

- They make a site difficult to design and maintain.

You have now been warned. Don't use them.

name: grid

# CSS Grid

## The skeleton of web layout

The **CSS Grid** system is typically used to create the main skeletal structure of web pages. This involves the following:

1. put a [container element](#containers) around the content you want to lay out
1. set the container element to have a `display` value of `grid`
1. set the container element to have a `grid-template-columns` value that defines the number of columns in the grid
1. set the container element to have a `grid-template-areas` value that defines the areas of the grid and their relative widths

---

template: grid

## Example - Cheerio Layout

Imagine the following classic web page layout with a header, footer, main content, left navigation bar and "right-rail" sidebar:

![CSS Cheerio Layout](../images/css-layout-cheerio.png)

---

template: grid

## Example - Cheerio Layout (HTML)

The `body` section of the HTML for such a page might contain code like this:

```html
<div class="container">
  <header>Header</header>
  <nav>Left nav</nav>
  <main>Main content</main>
  <aside>Right rail</aside>
  <footer>Footer</footer>
</div>
```

---

template: grid

## Example - Cheerio Layout (CSS)

The critical parts of the CSS code that would produce such a layout would be:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

```css
/* give grid system nicknames for each of the areas we want to lay out */
header { grid-area: header; }
nav { grid-area: left-nav; }
main { grid-area: main-content; }
aside { grid-area: right-rail; }
footer { grid-area: footer; }

.container {
  display: grid; /* turn on the grid system */
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr; /* relative widths of columns */

  /* now specify which nicknamed elements to put into which grid positions */
  grid-template-areas:
    "header     header        header"
    "left-nav   main-content  right-rail"
    "footer     footer        footer";
}


```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

name: flex

# CSS Flexbox

--

## Flexible layouts of components

While CSS Grid is most commonly used to create the outer structures of a web page, **CSS Flexbox** is often useful for laying out the inner content pieces that go within each skeletal area.

To use CSS Flex, we typically:

1. put a [container element](#containers) around the content you want to lay out
1. set the container element to have a `display` value of `flex` to turn on CSS Flex for that element.
1. set the container's `flex-direction` property to be either `row` or `column`, depending on whether you want to line up the inner elements horizontally or vertically.
1. set the container's `gap` property to be the desired spacing between the inner elements.
1. determine how the inner elements are justified within the container by setting the container's `justify-content` property.

---

template: grid

## Example - Content row

For example, consider an area containing three elements that sit side-by-side, where one element is wider than the others, and all elements are separated from each other by a gap.

![CSS Flexbox row](../images/css-layout-flexbox.png)

- We show boxes for simplicity only, but these could be any type of real content elements: `h1`, `p`, `img`, `ul`, `div`, etc.

---

template: flex

## Example - Content row (HTML)

The HTML code for such a content area might be:

```html
<div class="row">
  <div class="box1">box 1</div>
  <div class="box2">box 2</div>
  <div class="box3">box 3</div>
</div>
```

- Note the inner elements are shown as `div` for simplicity. These could be any type of element in practice.

---

template: flex

## Example - Content row (CSS)

The critical parts of the CSS code that would produce such a layout would be:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

```css
.row {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row; /* options are row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse; */
  gap: 1rem; /* gap between items, set to 1 times the font size of the root element (the html element), which by default is 16px in most browsers */
}

/* the following settings allow the three boxes to grow, where box 2 will grow up to 10 times as wide as box 1 and 2 */
.box1, .box3 { flex-grow: 1; }
.box2 { flex-grow: 10; }
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

At this point you have a solid understanding of the key concepts behind web page layout. You must _try it yourself_ to really understand how to apply it.
