# Overview

The layout of a web page is controlled by a few simple CSS concepts and rules. In order to get it right, we need to understand a few preliminary concepts.

---

name: containers

# Containers

---

template: containers
name: containers-1

## The HTML

To center the contents of a web page and to restrict the width of the page, we wrap the entire contents of the paage within a **container** or **wrapper** element.

```html
...
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <!-- put the contents of your page within this element -->
  </div>
</body>
...
```

---

template: containers
name: containers-2

## Restrict the page width

Now, we can easily restrict the page width to whatever width we like by adjusting this container's width.

```css
.container {
  width: 800px; /* you choose the width */
}
```

---

template: containers
name: containers-2

## Center the contents

We can also easily center the entire page within the browser's _viewport_ using margins.

```css
.container {
  width: 800px; /* container width must be smaller than the browser viewport width */
  /* equal margins on the left and right side of the containere */
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
```

---

template: containers
name: containers-3

## Warning: avoid setting heights

The height of the container, or any element for that matter, will always automatically adjust to fit the height of the contents you put within it.

If you were to set the height of an element to a fixed size, yet place more content nested within that element than can fit in that size, your layout would become corrupted.

# Calculating Widths

---

template: widths
name: widths-1

## The question

The width of an element can be a bit counter-intuitive to calculate.

Take this HTML:

```html
<article class="boxy">...</article>
```

And this CSS:

```css
.boxy {
  width: 400px;
  border: 1px solid red;
  padding: 20px;
  margin: 10px;
  background-color: pink;
}
```

What's the width of the `article` element?

---

template: widths
name: widths-2

## An answer

The actual width of an element includes:

- the _width_ of the element!
- any _border_ applied to either side of it
- any _padding_ applied to either side of it

```
actual width = width + left border + right border + left padding + right padding
```

---

template: widths
name: widths-3

## Another answer

The space consumed by an element also includes:

- any _margin_ applied to either side of it

```
actual width = width + left border + right border + left padding + right padding + left margin + right margin
```

# Block vs. Inline Elements

---

template: block-inline
name: block-inline-1

## Concept

Layout behavior of HTML elements is largely determined by the value of their CSS `display` property, which is one of three values.

...

```css
display: block;
```

```css
display: inline;
```

```css
display: none;
```

...

(In actuality there are other more specialized values for `display`, but we can safely ignore those for this discussion.)

---

template: block-inline
name: block-inline-2

## Common block elements

The `display` property is set to `block` for many elements, including:

- header
- footer
- main
- aside
- article
- section
- h1 - h6
- p
- ul and ol
- li
- div
- ... and more

---

template: block-inline
name: block-inline-3

## Block element behavior

The `block` value will cause the elements to have the following behavior:

- consume as much width as they can within their containing element
- refuse to sit side-by-side with other elements

---

template: block-inline
name: block-inline-4

## Common inline elements

The `display` property is set to `inline` for many text-related elements and images, including:

- a
- strong
- em
- img
- span
- ... and more

---

template: block-inline
name: block-inline-5

## Inline element behavior

The `inline` value will cause the elements to have the following behavior:

- consume only as much width as they need to surround the contents nested within them.
- happily sit side-by-side with other elements.

---

template: block-inline
name: block-inline-6

## Effects

The block/inline difference means that...

- we cannot set the widths of inline elements
- we also cannot set the left or right padding of inline elements
- we must use `block` elements to build the structure or skeleton of our web pages
- we will have to do extra work to get block elements to sit side-by-side
- inline elements will be used only to style bits of text and images.

# A Word About Divs and Spans

---

template: divs-spans
name: divs-spans-1

## Concept

There are two elements we will frequently use that have no semantic meaning:

- `div` - a `block` element with no semantic meaning
- `span` - an `inline` element with no semantic meaning

These are useful when you want to surround some content that you want to apply a style to, but you don't want to adjust that content's semantic meaning.

- So much for the much-touted _separation of concerns_!

---

name: position

# Position

---

template: position
name: position-1

## Positioning using the CSS position property

It is sometimes tempting to use the CSS position property to position elements on the page... it sounds like this is what the property is intended for.

The CSS `position` property can take three values:

- `static` - keep the element at its default position on the page
- `relative` - allows us to move the element from its static position by a particular number of pixels in the `top` or `left` directions
- `absolute` - allows us to absolutely position an element relative to the top-left corner of the page
- `fixed` - allows us to have an element stuck in the browser viewport at a specific position relative to the top-left corner of the viewport.

---

template: position
name: position-2

## Do not use these for general web page layout.

These `position` values are useful in some specific advanced contexts, but should never be used to layout the positions of all the main parts of a web page.

- They make a site difficult to design and maintain.

You have now been warned. Don't use them.

---

name: float-clear

# Float and Clear

---

template: float-clear
name: float-clear-1

## The secret to web layout

All layouts can be achieved with a few simple rules.

- Use `block` elements for the _structure_ or _skeleton_ of the layout.
- All `block` elements that must sit side-by-side with other elements must be given the `float: left` property
- Immediately after the last `float: left` element in the side-by-side row, put an invisibe `div` element with the style `clear: both`.

Now you can make any layout you wish for.

At this point you have a solid understanding of the key concepts behind web page layout. You must _try it yourself_ to really understand how to apply it.
